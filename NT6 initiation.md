- 👋 Hi, I’m @NT6x (the "x" is just because I couldn't put only the NT6).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about everything I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming, I don't have any knowledge in the area, but I will do my best to improve with time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what I know how to do. For now I still don't know how to do much, just a simple html.
- 📫 How to reach me:
- My contact e-mail: n.m.a.nt6@gmail.com
- Thank you for your attention.
- See you later.
- NT6_ <3
